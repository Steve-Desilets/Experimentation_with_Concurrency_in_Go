# Experimentation With Concurrency In Golang

For the project included within this Github repository, we imagine that we are a data scientist at a company whose leadership team is interested in leveraging Golang's concurrency features, such as goroutines and channels, in order to reap Golang's parallel processing computational benefits. Specifically, this company's leadership team is interested in studying how parallel processing can impact the company's operational efficiency when conducting data science analyses, such as calculating regression lines for datasets.  Accordingly, the company's leadership requests that the data scientist conduct an experiment to determine the computational efficiency of Golang when calculating regression lines, along with their mean squared error (MSE) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), when leveraging and when not leveraging Golang's concurrency features.

For this study, the data scientist leverages a dataset called "boston" that includes information about each of the 506 census tracks in Boston as of the time of the study  (Belsley, Kuh and Welsch 1980; Harrison and Rubinfeld 1978).  The variables included in this dataset are:
1. mv - Median Value of Homes in thousands of 1970 US dollars
2. nox - Air Pollution (nitrogen oxide concentration)
3. crim - Crime Rate
4. zn - Percentage of Land Zoned for Lots
5. indus - Percentage of Business that is Industrial or Nonretail
6. chas - On the Charles River (1) or not (0)
7. rooms - Average Number of Rooms per Home
8. age - Percentage of homes built before 1940
9. dis - Weighted Distance to Employment Centers
10. rad - Accessibility to Radial Highways
11. tax - Tax Rate
12. ptratio - Pupil / Teacher Ratio in Public Schools
13. lstat - Percentage of Population of Lower Socio-economic Status

For this study, the data scientist created the two Golang programs included within this repository - "Boston_Experiment_With_Concurrency.go" and "Boston_Experiment_No_Concurrency.go" - which complete the same task with the difference being that one program leverages goroutines for concurrency and the other does not leverage Golang's concurrency features.  Each program reads and parses the boston.csv file, calculates the regression line to predict median home values with every possible combination of four or more explanatory variables, and prints the results (including the MSE and AIC). Each program completes this exercise 100 times and records the time to calculate all those regression lines for each of the 100 trials. At the end, each program prints the average trial runtime and the sum of all the trial runtimes to an output text file - both of which are included in this Github repository.

If I were the data scientist making a recommendation to the leadership team of this company based on the findings of this study, I likely would recommend that the company begin leveraging Go instead of Python for its data engineering projects.  That's because previous experiments at this company (as described in the Command_Line_Applications and Benchmarking-Project Github repositories) have proven that Go is a much faster language computationally than Python is.  Given that Go can also produce equally excellent outputs when crawling and scraping the internet, Go should be the data engineering language of choice for this company.
